This project implements a working Flash Player Bitcoin Miner.

The core mining (hashing) is implemented in C and compiled with Alchemy to ActionScript VM.
The communication with a mining pool is implemented in ActionScript.
Both parts are rolled together into an SWF file ready to be embedded in an HTML document.

The SWF accepts following parameters: "host" and "port" number of the pool as well as "user" (worker name) and "pass" (worker password).
If host and port are omited then the miner will assume originating host
as the bitcoin mining pool server and 8332 as the default port number.

Flash objects embedded in HTML cannot connect to an arbitrary host.
Therefore, if you do not have your own mining pool on the same host you will have to use a proxy.
This project includes also a proxy which is implemented in Python and meant to run on Google AppEngine.

On an off the shelf HP Z400 machine the miner reaches ~120 khash/s.
The purpose of the code nothing more than a proof-of-concept.

Enjoy!
