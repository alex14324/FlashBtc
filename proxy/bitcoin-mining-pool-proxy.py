# Flash Player Bitcoin Miner
#
# This is the Bitcoin mining pool proxy service.
# Flash player code cannot connect to anything except for the originating host
# so to use any existing mining pool it was necessary to do it via a proxy service.
#
# When an HTTP GET request is made it will redirect to an example HTML file
# which demonstrates the use of the Flash Player Bitcoin Miner.
#
# The HTTP POST requests are simply channeled between the Flash Player file
# and the mining pool configured in the HTML file.
